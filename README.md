Far Vision: Build an application that holds the financial performance for a health management institution. This application will manage the adjustments, payments, and the sources that come in to the companies records.

Near Vision: Create a prototype of an application that includes all of the necessary categories of a practice management report. Integrate the services of the practice management reports with the other services made by the other teams.

Overall Vision:
This application will be for health care institutions to track all of their financial information in order to get an overall picture of their revenue. This product will be called Management Reports and it is a financial application. The key benefit for this application will be for the institution to better manage their sales growth and help manage their business. Unlike other services, this application will be tracking the revenue bi-weekly in order to give the institution a better understand of where they are in their goals. This product is going to be an application with a variety of different pieces such as charges, revenue, and the information from other departments transactions coming under one platform.
